- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter @tarawr
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Engineering!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python to perform EDA, cleansing and creation of interesting visualizations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun problems with a general "good" humanitarian aspect, or just things that are literally for fun like games/media.
